### Hi there 👋 from Barcelona 222

I'm Antonio Garcia (1969), a Visual Designer & FrontEnd Engineer from Barcelona.

I'm a design and technology enthusiast with a long career and an innovative spirit.

I started as a graphic designer, but the use of computers made me discover a world full of possibilities.

This has led me to collaborate with big companies and their technological projects, always using the latest technologies.
